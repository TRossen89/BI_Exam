## <div align='center'> - an Investigation into Connections Between GDP, Happiness, and Health of Nations </div>

### Introduction
How to distribute a nation's wealth, ensure its growth, and secure the well-being of its citizens are questions that both politicians and citizens care aboutâ€”or at least should care about. The goal of this project is to produce insights that can help answer these questions in ways that benefit both politicians and citizens.

More precisely, the project will investigate the following problem formulation:

- "How does the well-being or happiness of nations influence their GDP?"  
  
Additionally:  
  
- "Can data on well-being, health, unemployment, social expenditure, taxation, and GDP provide insights into what enhances or diminishes the GDP and well-being of nations?"
  
This research is important and interesting because the answers to these questions can have a direct impact on the wealth and well-being of citizens worldwide. The insights from this investigation could potentially help politicians and citizens alike to secure greater wealth and well-being for their countries.  
  
Before starting this project, my hypothesis was that well-being would have at least a small positive effect on GDP and that wealth and well-being would show a positive correlation. I also expected to find that a nation's GDP increases the healthier and happier its population is, the lower its unemployment rate is, the more it spends on social welfare, and the higher its taxes are.
