### Introduction

The distribution of a country's wealth and how to ensure the future wealth of a country, are questions that concern most politicans and citizens. My goal with this project has been to produce insights that can help politicians and citizens answer these questions. The project is based on data about the happiness, social expenditure, taxation, unemployment and GDP of different countries. It is expected that these features are connected in some way and that GDP can be predicted with some certainty from the other features. I see this project as a preliminary investigation that, with further investigations, will provide machine learning models which can predict GDP with enough precision to be used for politicians as a way to 

More precisely, the project had the following problem formulation:

- "Does the happiness of nations influence their GDP and can a machine learning model predict GDP from happiness indicators?"  
  
Additionally:  
  
- "Can data on happiness, health, unemployment, social expenditure, taxation, and GDP provide insights into what enhances or diminishes the GDP of nations?"
  
 

Before starting this project, my hypothesis was that happiness would have at least a small positive effect on or correlation with GDP. I also expected to find that a nation's GDP increases the happier its population is, the lower its unemployment rate is, the more it spends on social welfare, and the higher its taxes are.

#### Extraction and cleaning of data
I have used 4 different data sets from 4 different sources. The extraction and basic cleaning of the different dataset happens in four different Jupyter Notebooks which names all starts with 'Extracting...'. In the Notebook called 'Merging_data_frames'
